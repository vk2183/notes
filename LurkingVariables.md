# Lurking Variables
## What Are Lurking Variables?
- Lurking Variables are the peice of data that can actually have a huge impact on the statistical model
- It is a variable that is neither the explanatory variable nor the response variable but has a relationship (e.g. may be correlated) with the response and the explanatory variable
-  It is not considered in the study but could influence the relationship between the variables in the study.
#### Simpsons Paradox :
Simpson's Paradox is a statistical phenomenon where an association between two variables in a population emerges, disappears or reverses when the population is divided into subpopulations.
##### Example:
Lets say a hospital A saved 900 people out of 1000 and hospital B saved 800 out of 1000.

Looking at these values, you would prefer hospital A over B. (NOT CONSIDERING THE LURKING VARIABLE)

But, if we divide the data into how many at risk patients were admited and check the conversion rate for that of hospitals, we might get a whole different result of which hospital is better

Lets say, hospital A had 100 at risk patients, out of which 30 survived.Whereas, B had 400 at risk patients out of which 210 survived.

Now looking at these values we can conclude that hospital B is better than A.

## Why Are Lurking Variables Important?

- **Lurking variables skew data -** Till you identify the lurking variable, there is a risk of an unknown third variable skewing your statistical analysis.
  - **Eg -** we notice an increase in drownings and icecream sales at the same time. Lurking variable here can be hot weather which kinda makes people want to swim as well as eat icecream. So, hotter weather might be the more causative factor.

- **Lurking variables inspire new research -** Through regression analysis and other methodologies, we can both identify and utilize lurking variables to formulate new hypotheses. Determining causation can be difficult but the more variables we're aware of, better chances we have to find reach the root of the problem

- **Lurking variables help you solve problems -** When the independent and dependent variables of the data set don’t seem to correlate. Identifying a lurking variable can go a long way to show what might be going wrong in our experimental design. They can act as explanatory variables for previously unreadable problems.

## How To Identify A Lurking Variable:
Here are few tips to find the Lurking variables

**Assess your data.** 
- Go through all your dependent and independent variables, coefficients, and other inputs. 
- See if there are any possible elements you might be missing in your research. 
- Consider utilizing a linear or nonlinear regression model (depending on which is suitable) after you complete your modeling, as this can help you eliminate any residual issues with your study.

**Define the lurking variable**. 
- Look at other studies and examples of lurking variables in them. 
- Go back over your own research. See if there’s more of a positive correlation between your dependent variable with an extraneous data point than the independent variable you chose at first. 
- Try to do this before you even run your initial study if possible, as that will go the furthest in eliminating the potential amount of damage.

**Rerun your study.** 
- If you think you’ve found an influential lurking variable, consider running a parallel study with this variable to home in on its potential causative importance. 
- The goal of statistical research is to find the most likely cause of why data appears the way it does in any format. 
- Rerun your study with the lurking variable to see if it does, in fact, have a causative and strong relationship to your other variables.
